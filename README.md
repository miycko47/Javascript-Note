# Javascript Notes.

## What is javascript?

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### Variables.

* Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
* On this block of code x, y and z are declared with the "var" keyword.
```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

### Datatype.
There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript program. For example,
```
const x = 5;
const y = "Hello";
Here,
```
5 is an integer data.
"Hello" is a string data.
