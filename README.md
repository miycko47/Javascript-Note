# Javascript Notes.

## What is javascript?

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### Variables.

* Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
* On this block of code x, y and z are declared with the "var" keyword.
```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

### Datatype.
There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript program. For example,
```
const x = 5;
const y = "Hello";
Here,
```
5 is an integer data.
"Hello" is a string data.

### Conditional statement.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

- The if statmnet.
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
```
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
```
- The else Statement.
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
```
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```
- The else if Statement.
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
```
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```
## Loops.

- Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.
